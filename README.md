## Modern Application Development Workshop

This is a workshop to get developers started on AWS using the cloud native primitives. This workshop is designed as a self paced lab which incrementally increases in expertise

We will build a simple web app based on microservices using the 12 factor methodology, deploy it on the cloud and try some debug steps.

We will do this workshop in a pair programming mode. So find a buddy.

**Pre-requisite**

1. [Setup AWS account ](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/create-and-activate-aws-account/)
1. [SetUp Development Environment](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/codestar/latest/userguide/getting-started.html)

The modules build on each other and are intended to be executed linearly.
